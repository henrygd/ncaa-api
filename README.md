### Schedule

Returns game dates for a given sport, division, and date range.

This is the only route that doesn't exactly match a website URL. The website doesn't have schedule pages, but the sport and division are consistent with other URLs.

It also requires different dates for different sports. Football uses YYYY, while basketball, hockey, and others use YYYY/MM.

### Game

Provides details of a single game.

Website: <https://www.ncaa.com/game/6305900>

- `GET /game/6305900` returns general information
- `GET /game/6305900/boxscore` returns box score
- `GET /game/6305900/play-by-play` returns play by play
- `GET /game/6305900/scoring-summary` returns scoring summary if available
- `GET /game/6305900/team-stats` returns team stats if available

### Schools Index

Returns a list of all schools.

Website: <https://www.ncaa.com/schools-index>

`GET /schools-index`

## Deployment

Use the included [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) or run directly with docker:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 henrygd/ncaa-api
```

The app should be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/history/bowling/nc).

## Limiting Access

If you host your own instance, you may specify a custom header value to be present in all requests as a way to restrict access to the API. This isn't the most secure method, but it's better than nothing.

To do this, set the `NCAA_HEADER_KEY` environment variable to the desired value and include the header `x-ncaa-key` in your requests. See the [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) for an example.

## Development

This is a minimal [ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com/) app. To start the development server run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

To run tests:

```bash
bun test
```

Contributions welcome.
